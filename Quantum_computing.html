                A quantum computer - is a
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">computer</a>
                that exploits
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">quantum mechanical</a>
                phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveâ€“particle_duality">both particles and waves</a>,
                and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware.

                cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than
                any modern "classical" computer. In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used
                encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art
                is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications.

        The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or "quantum bit"), serves the same function as
        the bit in classical computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a
        qubit can exist in a superposition of its two "basis" states, which loosely means that it is in both states
        simultaneously. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum
        computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired
        measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer
        to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.

        Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently
        isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations.
        National governments have invested heavily in experimental research that aims to develop scalable qubits with
        longer coherence times and lower error rates. Two of the most promising technologies are superconductors (which
        isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic
        particle using electromagnetic fields).

        In principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough
        time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than computability, and quantum complexity
        theory shows that some quantum algorithms are exponentially more efficient than the best known classical
        algorithms. A large-scale quantum computer could in theory solve computational problems unsolvable by a
        classical computer in any reasonable amount of time. While claims of such quantum supremacy have drawn
        significant attention to the discipline, near-term practical use cases remain limited.
